Hi. This is common files with questions. Maybe I (Braivs) or somebody else will solve this later :)

-decks.service.ts: invalidatesTags: ['CardsIdDeck'] now works together with onQueryStarted
-How to separate onQueryStarted to function?
-Do we need invalidatesTags together with onQueryStarted?
-cards-page: Is is possible to store deckId without useEffect?
